## 2102.06719<br>Double detonations of sub-MCh CO white dwarfs:Can different core and He shell masses explain variations of Type Ia supernovae?  
### home message
##### work:  
* three-dimensional simulations of double detonations in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with a helium shell<br>
模型参数：different core and shell masses.<br>
* 展示从上述模拟中预测得的the bolometric light curves用 Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS得到）, 并与观测得的SNe Ia数据比较.<br>
* We show the model bolometric width-luminosity relation compared to data for a range of model viewing angles.<br>

##### conclusion:  
1. different core detonation ignition mechanisms depending on the core and shell mass configuration. This has an influence on the ejecta structure.<br>
2. The bolometric light curves of our models show a range of brightnesses, able to account for sub-luminous to normal brightness SNe Ia.<br>
3. on average, our brighter models lie within the observed data.<br>
4. the bolometric decline rate over 40 days, appears systematically faster than data.<br>

##### problem：  
普遍认为Sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with a surface helium shell 的progenitors是SNe Ia, 那模拟SNe Ia的thermonuclear explosions应该符合至少部分SNe Ia的观测数据.<br>





## 2101.04722<br>Atomic line radiative transfer with MCFOST I. Code description and benchmarking
### home message
##### work:
* We present MCFOST-art, a new non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer solver for multilevel atomic systems.<br>
* using the Multilevel Accelerated Lambda Iteration (MALI) method.<br>tested MCFOST-art on spherically symmetric models of stellar photospheres as well as on a standard model of the solar atmosphere.<br>
* tested both the pure local thermodynamic equilibrium and the out-of-equilibrium problems.<br>

##### conclusion:
1. In all cases, the results from all codes agree within a few percent at all wavelengths and reach the sub-percent level between RH and MCFOST-art.<br>
2. agreement between MCFOST-art and both TURBOspectrum and RH is excellent, of the order of 1% or below at most wavelengths.<br>
3. a few discrepancies are present, arising from the different treatment of opacities at a few critical wavelengths (e.g. at the Balmer jump or at the H􀀀 minimum).<br>
4. RH和MCFOST的流量差异达25% in the core of Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$和大部分other wavelengths in the spectrum的差异低至1%.

## 2103.06900<br>Particle acceleration in radio galaxies with flickering jets: GeV electrons to ultrahigh energy cosmic rays
### home message
##### work:
* introduce a semi-analytic model for particle acceleration and radio jet/lobe evolution and explore the effect of Myr timescale **jet variability** on the particles accelerated by an AGN jet.<br>
* resulting spectrum: log-normal distribuion of powers.<br>
* demonstrate the link between the history of an astrophysical particle accelerator and its particle contents, nonthermal emission and UHECR spectrum<br>


##### conclusion:
1. UHECR and nonthermal radiative luminosities track the jet power but with a response set by the escape and cooling times, respectively.<br>
2. **jet variability** produces structure in the electron, synchrotron and UHECR spectra that deviates from that produced for a constant jet power – in particular, spectral **hardening features** may be signatures of variability<br>
3. the cutoff in the integrated CR spectrum is stretched out due to the variation in jet power (and, consequently, maximum CR energy).<br>
4. $\sim$ 10 GeV 'proxy electrons' that are cooling at the same rate that UHECRs of rigidity 10 EV are escaping from the source, and determine
the corresponding photon frequencies that probe escaping UHECRs.

##### problem:
to find: 1) local powerful *ultrahigh energy cosmic ray*(UHECR) sources; 2)evidence for variability in AGN and radio galaxies.<br>



## 2103.07495<br>Using Shell Models to Investigate Clumping in the Wind of the O7Iaf+ Supergiant AzV83
### home message
##### work:
* treat a clumpy wind as a series of dense, spherically symmetric shells embedded
* on a non-void interclump medium in the 1D radiative transfer code CMFGEN.<br>
model spectra of AzV83
* shell model 2D code

##### conclusion:
a factor of ten lower than needed with the volume-filling factor approach<br>
* model results:<br>
Its spectra shows evidence of a relatively strong mass loss, similar to a WR
star, as well as a wealth of photospheric features.<br>
the Shell model the ionisation does not vary smoothly with radius – the ionisation fraction in the ICM differs from that in the core of the shell by as much as three orders of magnitude.

##### problem:
* the winds are inhomogeneous (clumped) and are difficult to model in radiative transfer codes,<br>
* VFF(The volume-filling factor approach is the principal method adopted to treat clumping) is simplistic<br>
* to treat clumpy winds more realistically and test the validity of the VFF approach<br>

## 2103.08687v1<br>Imaginary images and Stokes phenomena in the weak plasma lensing of coherent sources
### home message
##### work:
extract the physical parameters of the lensing system.<br>
rational lens model
##### conclusion:
* in weak-lensing regimes, where only a single geometric image is present, diffraction patterns caused by interference with imaginary images can provide the same phase information as though multiple geometric images were interfering.
* for any event observed in the strong-lensing regime, there will be a corresponding weak-lensing event in higher frequency bands.
* FRBs lensed by plasma lenses in our own galaxy will have much smaller time delays.

### note
* coherent source: such as pulsars, FRB = coherent point-sources. Wave effects will be important in describing their lensing behaviour.
* Stokes line : generic features of many lens models, regions in parameter space where imaginary images begin to contribute to the overall intensity modulation of lensed sources.
* extreme scattering events (ESEs): radio sources' intensity undergo large, frequency dependent changes, so as pulsars. Lens models were proposed to explain it.
* Pulsars have been observed to undergo ESEs caused by roughly AU-scale lenses, with electron column densities of order $\sim 0.01 pc\, cm^{-3}$

## 2103.09248<br>RX J0529.8-6556: a BeXRB pulsar with an evolving optical period and out of phase X-ray outbursts
### home message
##### work:
* details about the analysis of the X-ray data collected during the 2020 X-ray outburst.
* investigate the long-term variability of the system using archival X-ray data obtained by Swift and XMM-Newton.

##### conclusion:
* during the decay of the June 2020 outburst, when the luminosity had only decreased by $\sim 35\%$ , the pulse profile morphology had clearly changed.
* an anisotropic accretion mechanism was needed to explain the observed X-ray pulsations.
* observational effects of LXP 69.5 could be consistent with the Be disc plane and orbital plane being misaligned.

### note
* High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs)= a WD/NS/BH + an O-/B-star. a sub-class are Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs).
* The Be disc is the source of emission lines and infrared excess that set Be
stars apart from ordinary O/B-stars
