## 2102.06719<br>Double detonations of sub-MCh CO white dwarfs:Can different core and He shell masses explain variations of Type Ia supernovae?  
### home message
##### work:  
1. three-dimensional simulations of double detonations in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with a helium shell<br>
模型参数：different core and shell masses.<br>
2. 展示从上述模拟中预测得的the bolometric light curves用 Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS得到）, 并与观测得的SNe Ia数据比较.<br>
3. We show the model bolometric width-luminosity relation compared to data for a range of model viewing angles.<br>

##### conclusion:  
1. different core detonation ignition mechanisms depending on the core and shell mass configuration. This has an influence on the ejecta structure.<br>
2. The bolometric light curves of our models show a range of brightnesses, able to account for sub-luminous to normal brightness SNe Ia.<br>
3. on average, our brighter models lie within the observed data.<br>
4. the bolometric decline rate over 40 days, appears systematically faster than data.<br>

##### problem：  
普遍认为Sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with a surface helium shell 的progenitors是SNe Ia, 那模拟SNe Ia的thermonuclear explosions应该符合至少部分SNe Ia的观测数据.<br>



##2101.04722<br>Atomic line radiative transfer with MCFOST I. Code description and benchmarking
### home message
##### work:
1. We present MCFOST-art, a new non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer solver for multilevel atomic systems.<br>
2. using the Multilevel Accelerated Lambda Iteration (MALI) method.<br>tested MCFOST-art on spherically symmetric models of stellar photospheres as well as on a standard model of the solar atmosphere.<br>
3. tested both the pure local thermodynamic equilibrium and the out-of-equilibrium problems.<br>

##### conclusion:
1. In all cases, the results from all codes agree within a few percent at all wavelengths and reach the sub-percent level between RH and MCFOST-art.<br>
2. agreement between MCFOST-art and both TURBOspectrum and RH is excellent, of the order of 1% or below at most wavelengths.<br>
3. a few discrepancies are present, arising from the different treatment of opacities at a few critical wavelengths (e.g. at the Balmer jump or at the H􀀀 minimum).<br>
4. RH和MCFOST的流量差异达25% in the core of Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$和大部分other wavelengths in the spectrum的差异低至1%.
